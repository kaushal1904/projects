Used pycharm to build, test and run the application on MacOS 15.1
Application will run in any python IDE as long as the supported libraries and binaries are installed
Built the GUI using the tkinter GUI toolkit, documentation -> https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

This application can be used in any system that needs to parse text from a pdf file  

The OCR scanner package pytesseract has a good recognition rate, all text in the file is recognized. Set the lang parameter on line 42
