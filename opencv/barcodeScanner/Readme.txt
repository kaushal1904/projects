Used pycharm to build, test and run the application 
Application will run in any python IDE as long as the supported libraries and binaries are installed 
The code is accompanied with detailed comments for novice programmers 

This application can be used in Inventory management, POS systems, Ticket verification and Manufacturing 
Tweak the code accordingly

The barcode scanner library (pyzbar) has a good recognition rate, make sure to use a decent camera with good lighting 
Built a few custom bar codes using https://barcode.tec-it.com/en and https://www.zoho.com/in/inventory/free-barcode-generator/ 
which worked with the application
