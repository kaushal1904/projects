Used pycharm to build, test and run the application 
Application will run in any python IDE as long as the supported libraries and binaries are installed 
Refer to barcodeScanner.py ~ https://github.com/kaushal1904/projects/blob/main/opencv/barcodeScanner/barcodeScanner.py for detailed description of similar code  

This application can be used in product tracking, time tracking, item identification, document identification, contact sharing and linking content
Tweak the code accordingly

The qrcode scanner function cv2.QRCodeDetector() has a good recognition rate, make sure to use a decent camera with good lighting 
Built a few custom QR codes using https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/ 
which worked with the application
