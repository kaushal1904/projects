API testing an application involves a software testing phase to check the new build's stability and ensure core APIs work. 

This suite has API test cases for Get, Post, Put and Delete requests. Used Visual Studio Code to build, test and run the application on MacOS 15.7.3. 

This suite can be used to understand the basics of REST APIs and perform sanity testing on any server. Make sure to set the 
"$base_url" in API calls to url you want to test accordingly. 
1. const response = await request.get('$base_url') 
2. const response = await request.post('$base_url') 
3. const response = await request.put('$base_url') 
4. const response = await request.delete('$base_url') 

Change the "$base_url" to the URL you want to test and verify the responses. Requests and the parameters should be set accordingly.
