This application can be used to understand the basics of REST APIs and perform sanity testing on any server. Make sure to set the base URL, requests and the parameters accordingly

Change the "base_url" to the URL you want in the main.py file and verify the responses, requests and the parameters should be set accordingly

Used pycharm to build, test and run the application on MacOS 15.1
Application will run in any python IDE as long as the supported packages and binaries are installed 

Run the main.py for the application to execute
