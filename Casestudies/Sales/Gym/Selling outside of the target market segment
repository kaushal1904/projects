Selling outside of the target market segment

Problem Statement: Selling membership to members who play a sport which does not require strength and conditioning 

Summary: Got a lead from an existing member regarding a potential member. The person still being under 18 I had to convince his dad to purchase the membership. 
He played a sport that did not require any strength and conditioning, the challenge here was to convince his dad to buy the membership even if his son played a sport 
that did not require strength and conditioning. Our target market segment was gym goers.

Solution: During the call with the potential memberâ€™s dad, I sold him about our offerings in cardio and HIIT (High intensity training) apart from the weights 
and machines specifically for regular gym goers. He was worried about his body getting stiff by lifting weights, hence the suggestion of cardio and HIIT in the gym.
After almost 20 mins over the call eventually his dad agreed and now his son works out in the gym for his cardio and HIIT needs. 

Conclusion: Sometimes selling outside of a target segment is a problem you may come across, and to customise it to a specific customer needs is a challenge in itself. 
Convincing takes time and patience, being spontaneous and honest helps to close the sale.
