Power outage scenario 

Problem Statement:  Members getting frustrated due to power outages in the gym 

Summary: There were frequent power outages in the gym caused by an unstable fuse. Air conditioned gym being one of the selling points of the gym, members were 
frustrated. Had to manage the situation of new members who were worried and some even asking for a refund. There were a lot of members who came up to the kiosk
with frustration to know when the problem was getting solved. The fuse was changed and unfortunately the situation remained the same for some more days. 
Members leaving the gym without their complete workout or not working out at the gym itself. Also had to deal with potential member walk-ins when there was a 
power outage and assure them about the working of the ACs, hence losing some business and not reaching the sales target in time. Sporadic power out ages lead to 
closure of the gym for almost 2 weeks.

Solution: Handle member queries and frustration in a respectful and subtle way so that you do not lose business. It was decided by the management team to extend
the membership days with the lost days due to power outages. 

Conclusion: Operational downtime is a regular occurrence in any business setup, solving it in a way that does not harm the business is needed for continued 
profits and smooth operations. Fake assurances back fire intentional or otherwise. Be ready to get yelled at during the operations downtime.
