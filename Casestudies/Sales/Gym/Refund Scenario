Problem Statement: Member asked for a refund after buying the membership within an hour while there is strictly no refund policy

Summary: Weekâ€™s first sale, a potential member walked in enquiring regarding membership at the gym, bought the membership happily and was excited to get started. 
An hour later called me and said he would like a refund because he has some emergency and would like the money back. Keep in mind, there is absolutely no refund 
policy at the gym (mentioned on the brochure) and in most gyms. I told him about the no refund policy over the phone and gave him the option to transfer his 
membership to someone else which would cost him a nominal fee. He was adamant, wanting a refund and nothing else. Spoke over the phone for almost half an hour yet
his decision did not change. He called me back several times, tried convincing me for a refund and on a particular day called from a police station and said he 
will file a complaint in case there was no refund initiated. 

Solution: Although there is clearly no refund policy at the gym, I told him I will discuss this with the management team and get back to him with a response. 
After discussing it with the team, there was clearly a no from them. The best in my capacity was to connect him with one of the team members so that they take 
it forward from there. Eventually the money was refunded after weeks of to and fro with the team considering his situation of his family member being hospitalised. 

Conclusion: Being in such a strenuous situation can be stressful after making a sale. That too it being the first sale of the day and the week. 
You may come across situations where you do the best in your capacity yet are not able to resolve the situation. Escalating it to someone who can resolve 
it is essential so that business does not cease to operate. Sales and Business development is a money making skill, having empathy in certain situations can 
be good karma.
